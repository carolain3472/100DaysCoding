#I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
#https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

#It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# 游뚿 Don't change the code below 游녢
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# 游뚿 Don't change the code above 游녡

#Write your code below this line 游녢

edad= int(age)
a침os_faltantes= 90-edad

dias= (a침os_faltantes*365)
semanas= (a침os_faltantes*52)
meses= (a침os_faltantes*12)

print(f"You have {dias} days, {semanas} weeks, and {meses} months left.")
